# mity
`mity` is a bioinformatic analysis pipeline designed to call mitochondrial SNV and INDEL variants from Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) data. `mity` can:
* identify very low-heteroplasmy variants, even <1% heteroplasmy when there is sufficient read-depth (eg >1000x)
* filter out common artefacts that arise from high-depth sequencing
* easily integrate with existing nuclear DNA analysis pipelines (mity merge)
* provide an annotated report, designed for clinicians and researchers to interrogate

# Usage
    mity -h

# Dependencies
* python3 (tested on 3.7.4)
* freebayes >= 1.2.0
* bgzip + tabix
* gsort (https://github.com/brentp/gsort)
* pyvcf
* xlsxwriter
* pandas

# Installation
Installation instructions via Docker, pip, or manually are available in [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/KCCG/mity/blob/master/INSTALL.md)

# Example Usage
This is an example of calling variants in the Ashkenazim Trio.

## mity call
First run `mity call` on three MT BAMs provided in [mity/test_in](https://github.com/KCCG/mity/blob/master/test_in). CRAM files are supported.

We recommend always using `--normalise`, or `mity report` won't work:
```bash
mity call \
--prefix ashkenazim \
--out-folder-path test_out \
--region MT:1-500 \
--normalise \
test_in/HG002.hs37d5.2x250.small.MT.RG.bam \
test_in/HG003.hs37d5.2x250.small.MT.RG.bam \
test_in/HG004.hs37d5.2x250.small.MT.RG.bam 
```
This will create `test_out/normalised/ashkenazim.mity.vcf.gz` (and tbi file).

or, if using Docker:
```
docker run -w "$PWD" -v "$PWD":"$PWD" drmjc/mity call \
--prefix ashkenazim \
--out-folder-path test_out \
--region MT:1-500 \
--normalise \
test_in/HG002.hs37d5.2x250.small.MT.RG.bam \
test_in/HG003.hs37d5.2x250.small.MT.RG.bam \
test_in/HG004.hs37d5.2x250.small.MT.RG.bam 
```

## mity report

We can create a `mity report` on the normalised VCF:
```bash
mity report \
--prefix ashkenazim \
--min_vaf 0.01 \
--out-folder-path test_out \
test_out/ashkenazim.mity.vcf.gz
```
This will create: `test_out/ashkenazim.annotated_variants.csv` and `test_out/ashkenazim.annotated_variants.xlsx`.

## mity normalise
High-depth sequencing and sensitive variant calling can create many variants with more than 2 alleles, and in some
cases, joins two nearby variants separated by shared `REF` sequence into a multi-nucleotide polymorphism 
as discussed in the manuscript. Here, variant normalisation relates to decomposing the multi-allelic variants and 
where possible, splitting multi-nucleotide polymorphisms into their cognate smaller variants. At the time of writing,
all variant decomposition tools we used failed to propagate the metadata in a multi-allelic variant to the split
variants which caused problems when reporting the quality scores associated with each variant.
  
Technically you can run `mity call` and `mity normalise` separately, but since `mity report` requires a normalised 
vcf file, we recommend running `mity call --normalise`. 

## mity merge
You can merge a nuclear vcf.gz file and a mity.vcf.gz file thereby replacing the MT calls from the nuclear VCF (
presumably from a caller like HaplotypeCaller which is not able to sensitively call mitochondrial variants) with
the calls from `mity`.

```bash
mity merge \
--prefix ashkenazim \
--mity_vcf test_out/ashkenazim.mity.vcf.gz \
--nuclear_vcf todo-create-example-nuclear.vcf.gz
```

# Recommendations for interpreting the report
Assuming that you are looking for a pathogenic variant underlying a patient with a rare genetic disorder potentially 
caused by a Mitochondrial mutation, then we recommend the following strategy:
1. tier 1 or 2 variants included in the 'commercial_panels' column 
2. tier 1 or 2 variants that match the clinical presentation and the phenotype in 'disease_mitomap', preferably 
those that are annotated with Confirmed evidence in the 'status_mitomap' column
3. exclude common variants: anything linked to 'phylotree_haplotype', high 'phylotree_haplotype', high 
'MGRB_frequency', high 'GenBank_frequency_mitomap'.
4. consider any remaining tier 1 or 2 variants that may have a predicted impact on tRNA
5. consider any remaining variants with high numbers of 'variant_references_mitomap'
5. if you have analysed multiple family members, consider variants who's level of 'variant_heteroplasmy' match the
disease burden 
6. tier 3 variants have low numbers of supporting reads, and should be considered with caution. However we have observed
numerous tier 3 variants, especially in WGS from blood, that match the pathogenic allele known to be at much higher 
heteroplasmy in the affected tissue (this phenomenon is well established in the literature). Thus, if there are any 
tier 3 variants identified that match the patient's clinical presentation, then we recommend considering these
as candidate variants and validating using an orthogonal clinically validated assay, preferably on the disease 
affected tissue.

# Reference genomes
## Human
`mity` natively supports the analysis of the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS, RefSeq ID NC_012920.1). The
rCRS used in most human reference genomes from NCBI (GRCh37, hs37d5, GRCh38) and hg38 from UCSC, where it is either 
named `chrM`, or `MT`. The main exception in common use is the `hg19` reference genome from UCSC, which used a different
sequence (RefSeq NC_001807) which differs in length by 2bp, and sharing 99% sequence homology (16530/16572 identities) 
and 4 gaps. For now, `mity call` supports the hg19 reference, but `mity report` will not annotate variants properly, so 
you should not use this part of the pipeline. We strongly recommend that for mitochondrial analysis, to use a reference
genome that uses the rCRS sequence.

| Reference   | contig name | RefSeq ID   | length   | rCRS | 
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ---------| ---- |
| GRCh37      | chrM        | NC_012920.1 | 16569 bp | rCRS |
| hs37d5      | MT          | NC_012920.1 | 16569 bp | rCRS |
| hg19 (UCSC) | chrM        | NC_001807.4 | 16571 bp | no   |
| GRCh38      | chrM        | NC_012920.1 | 16569 bp | rCRS |

## Mouse
`mity` `call` and `normalise` support the analysis of the mouse genome (`mity call --reference mm10 ...`). `mity report`
currently only supports variant annotation to the human rCRS sequence.

# Commonly asked Questions
## Base quality score recalibration (BQSR)
Most of the development of `mity` was tested on BAM files that had undergone GATK's BQSR method, which improves the 
base qualities of each read. 
In our experience, this reduced the quality score of most bases by ~10 points, indicating that the base qualities 
straight out of the sequencer are generally inflated. As the GATK best practices guide no longer recommends BQSR, it's 
reasonable to ask whether `mity` can be run on BAM files straight out of the aligner.
`mity` has a custom QUAL score, which depends on the base qualities of only the reads that support the alternative 
allele.  
For tier 1 or 2 variants, there will be so many supporting reads, that any miscalibration of base quality scores will
have no material effect. Tier 3 variants with very few supporting reads may be impacted, where a variant with only 3 or
4 supporting reads may end up having a stronger mity QUAL score than after BQSR. The comment above regarding how you
should interpret and validate tier 3 variant still holds. 
We would appreciate any feedback you may have on this.

## CRAM support
CRAM support was added to `mity call` in v0.4.0.
